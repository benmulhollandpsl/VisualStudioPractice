## About this course
> _Learn the essentials of Visual Studio, the integrated development environment from Microsoft. Unlock the power of Visual Studio tools for writing, refactoring, and debugging code._

Integrated development environments (IDE) make it faster and easier to write high-quality code. Visual Studio, the IDE from Microsoft, has every tool you need to be a productive developerâ€”regardless of your language, programming style, or project type. This course offers a comprehensive introduction to Visual Studio, allowing you to explore the tools and features and configure Visual Studio to support your needs. Instructor Walt Ritscher shows how to implement version control with Git, adjust the editor preferences, code more efficiently with IntelliSense and code snippets, and use the built-in tools in Visual Studio for refactoring and debugging code. Plus, learn how to make Visual Studio even more robust by capitalizing on the library of free and paid extensions in the Visual Studio Marketplace.

## Branches

The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `chapter#-video#`. As an example, the branch named `02-03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter.
Some branches will have a beginning state (`04-01`) and an end state (`04-01e`). The end state videos use `e` for "end" and contains the code as it is at the end of the video. The `master` branch holds the the initial state of the course and is not used for exercises during the course.
## Installing
